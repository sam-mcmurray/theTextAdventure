# theTextAdventure

	We were asked to design and implement an application as a project, so we chose to create a text 
adventure game which is written in java programming language.  The user is tasked with escaping from a 
labyrinth by finding keys and collecting items.  While the goal is to escape, points are earned by
collecting “treasures” throughout the game that will increase their score.. The user has two choices
either fight or flee both options can have deadly consequences!  If the user chooses to fight the
monster, they may face a grizzly end. Escape is possible if your fast enough, but you won’t discover 
as much treasure. The user can find items to help along their journey, the items can rejuvenate health
and add additional lives. One of the items being keys to open the locked doors and another being
hidden treasure which increases the score. The user will be able to save and load game, the user
will also be able to save the high score
